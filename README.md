1.	Upload GANs.ipynb file through upload option through colab

2.	Run top 2 cells. So that the directory is created /contents/MI/images

3.	Then in left column of the colab in the created images folder upload the datset images directly into the images folder. Following screenshot shows the demo.

Select all the images by going to particular dataset folder. Click Open.
4.	Press Run all. So that all the cells execute one after another.

5.	Finally after executing all the cells, we get, generated images folder in /content/ directory. So all the images generated after 50 epochs is stored there. 
•	For ipynb for without preprocessing we get video of generated images in /content/MI directory . 
•	For ipynb for with preprocessing we get video of generated images in /content/MI1 directory .

6) TO run again from first delete gans_training.avi first and run again.
